//! A cheap render-performance guard that is safe to gate CI on.
//!
//! Ports the instinct behind
//! `Winged-Swift/Tests/WingedSwiftTests/RenderPerformanceTests.swift`, which asserts on
//! **output size** rather than elapsed time. A size assertion is deterministic across
//! machines and CI runners; a timing assertion is not, which is why the criterion suite in
//! `benches/render.rs` is not part of `cargo test`.
//!
//! What this catches: an accidental change that starts emitting extra whitespace, repeats
//! an attribute, or silently drops children — all of which move the byte count long before
//! anyone notices them in a diff.
